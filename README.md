Easy-Linux-Security
===================

_Looking for a new maintainer for this package. Open an issue if interested._

ELS stands for Easy Linux Security. ELS was originally created by the Server Monkeys Founder, Richard Gannon but I (Chris Harvey) have decided to use the source code to make an all-new ELS. ELS takes many of the tasks performed by our Administrators and puts it into an easy to use program for anyone to use. It is released under the GNU/GPL so it is free to use.
